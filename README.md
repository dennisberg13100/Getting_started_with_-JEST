# Getting started with JEST
This is a dummy project to learn how to run tests with Jest

There ar 2 important files in this repository, functions.js and functions.test.js.

In the file functions.js I export an Object with several functions to be tested. The functions are very simple and mostly just return something to be tested. 

In the functions.test.js this functions ares tested on several ways.
